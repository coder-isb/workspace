### **Project: Cloud Data Warehouse Implementation for Member Enrollment – Insurance Domain**

**Client:** Leading Health Insurance Firm
**Duration:** [Insert Duration, e.g., Jan 2024 – Dec 2024]
**Role:** Data Engineer / Cloud Data Warehouse Developer

**Project Summary:**
The project focused on modernizing the client’s **Member Enrollment Data Warehouse** by migrating from an on-premise **IBM DB2** system with **Ab Initio**-based orchestration to a **cloud-native data warehouse on Snowflake**. The new solution was designed to support complex enrollment structures involving **Groups, Subgroups, Riders, Plans, and Members**, ensuring scalable, efficient, and accurate data integration for downstream analytics and reporting.

**Business Context:**
The member enrollment process in the insurance domain involves managing multiple hierarchies and relationships:

* **Group:** Represents an employer or organization that sponsors insurance coverage for its employees or members.
* **Subgroup:** Defines subdivisions within a group (e.g., department or regional divisions) with distinct coverage rules.
* **Plan / Rider:** Specifies coverage options or additional benefits (e.g., dental, vision, or wellness riders) attached to the base insurance plan.
* **Member:** Refers to an individual subscriber or dependent enrolled under a plan.

The project aimed to integrate and harmonize these entities into a unified data model to support eligibility validation, billing, claims processing, and regulatory reporting.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Conducted impact analysis of the existing **DB2 schema** and **Ab Initio ETL workflows** for Group, Subgroup, Rider, Plan, and Member datasets.
* Designed a **Snowflake-based dimensional model** encompassing staging, integration, and presentation layers to represent hierarchical enrollment relationships.
* Developed **ETL pipelines** for ingestion and transformation of enrollment data using **Snowflake SQL**, **Snowpipe**, and **cloud orchestration tools** (e.g., Airflow / Azure Data Factory / AWS Glue – specify as applicable).
* Implemented **data mapping and transformation logic** to handle complex scenarios like retroactive enrollments, plan changes, rider additions, and member terminations.
* Established **data quality checks**, referential integrity constraints, and audit frameworks to ensure accuracy and compliance.
* Partnered with business analysts and actuarial teams to validate enrollment metrics and support downstream analytics such as enrollment trends, coverage utilization, and premium calculation.

**Technologies Used:**
Snowflake | DB2 | Ab Initio | SQL | Cloud Platform (AWS / Azure / GCP – specify) | Airflow / ADF | Python | Git | Data Modeling (Star/Snowflake Schema)

**Outcome:**

* Successfully migrated and modernized the legacy enrollment warehouse to Snowflake.
* Improved data refresh and processing time by over **40%**.
* Enhanced scalability and enabled near real-time access to enrollment and plan data for analytics, reporting, and compliance needs.
* Streamlined management of Group–Subgroup–Rider–Member relationships, improving data accuracy and traceability across the enrollment lifecycle.
